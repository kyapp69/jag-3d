A C++ 3D rendering toolkit designed for OpenGL v4.0 (and later) core profile.

[Doxygen documentation with dependency info and build instructions.](http://www.skew-matrix.com/Jag3D)

The JAG project is currently under development. Jag3D v0.1 was tagged 4 November 2013.

Design goals:
  * Provide a scene graph and draw graph for OpenGL command storage and spatial organization of 3D scene components.
  * Provide minimal OpenGL abstraction to facilitate multidisplay and multicontext rendering.
  * A plugin architecture for loading models, images, and other data objects.
  * Full compatibility with existing OpenGL 4.0 projects and applications.
  * Use off-the-shelf technology where possible and practical (smart pointers, math library, logging, etc).
  * Windowing system independent.

Future goals:
  * OpenGL ES compatibility.
  * Fully cross-platform (Windows, Linus, OSX).
